                <p>Lorem <stron> is simply dummy </strong>
                        text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
                        been the
                        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
                        type
                        and
                        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                        leap
                        into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                        with
                        the
                        release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                        publishing
                        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                    McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
                    obscure
                    Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                    classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
                    1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
                    BC.
                    This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
                    of
                    Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32
